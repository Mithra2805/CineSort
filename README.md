CineSort: Movie Genre Classification
CineSort is a machine learning-based project designed to classify movies into different genres using various features such as movie description, cast, and metadata. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to build an accurate and efficient movie genre prediction model.

Project Overview
The goal of CineSort is to develop a robust machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on multiple features such as:

Plot descriptions
Cast members
Movie title
Release year
Language
This project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and classify movie data into predefined genres, such as Drama, Comedy, Action, Horror, etc. The model can be applied to automate categorization for movie databases, movie recommendation systems, or even production planning in the entertainment industry.

Installation
To get started with CineSort, follow these steps to set up the environment and install dependencies:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CineSort.git
cd CineSort
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The dataset used for this project is a collection of movie information, which includes features such as:

Title: The movie's title.
Plot: A short description or plot of the movie.
Cast: The main actors and actresses.
Release Year: The year the movie was released.
Language: The language of the movie.
Genres: The movie's genre, which will be the target variable.
Example Data:
Title	Plot	Cast	Release Year	Language	Genre
The Dark Knight	A vigilante in Gotham must face the Joker	Christian Bale, Heath Ledger	2008	English	Action
Titanic	A love story set on the ill-fated ship	Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet	1997	English	Drama
The Hangover	A group of friends must find a missing groom	Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms	2009	English	Comedy
Note: The dataset can be downloaded from a public source, such as IMDb, or you can use any movie dataset of your choice.

Usage
Once the project is set up and dependencies are installed, you can start using the movie genre classification model.

To train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will train the model using the movie dataset and store the trained model for later use.

To predict the genre of a new movie based on its description:

bash
Copy code
python predict_genre.py --input "The movie description here"
The script will output the predicted genre based on the movie's description.

For batch predictions (e.g., predicting genres for a list of movies from a CSV file):

bash
Copy code
python batch_predict.py --input "movies.csv" --output "predictions.csv"
This will take a CSV file of movie descriptions and output the predictions to a new file.

Model Description
In CineSort, we use the following approaches and techniques:

Text Preprocessing: We apply techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare the movie descriptions for analysis.

Feature Extraction: We extract features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings to convert text data into numerical representations.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression: A baseline model to predict movie genres.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model for text classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A classifier for high-dimensional feature spaces.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for classification.
Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The performance of the models will be evaluated on a test dataset. Example results are as follows:

Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 84%
Recall: 83%
F1-Score: 83.5%
Random Forest:

Accuracy: 88%
Precision: 87%
Recall: 85%
F1-Score: 86%
The Random Forest model performed the best, achieving high accuracy and reliable classification across different genres.
